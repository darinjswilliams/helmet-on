**Workplace Safety Enhancement through Automated Helmet Detection**

**Ensuring safety in high-risk environments—such as construction sites and industrial facilities—is paramount to minimizing workplace accidents and injuries. Among the most critical safety protocols is the mandatory use of protective helmets, which safeguard personnel from head trauma caused by falling objects or operational machinery. However, lapses in helmet compliance significantly elevate the risk of severe injury or fatality. Traditional manual monitoring, particularly in large-scale operations, is often inefficient and error-prone.**

**To address these limitations, SafeGuard Corp is initiating the development of an automated image analysis system designed to detect and verify helmet usage in real time. This solution aims to strengthen safety enforcement, streamline compliance monitoring, and reduce the incidence of preventable head injuries. By replacing manual oversight with intelligent automation, the system will enhance operational efficiency, improve scalability, and ensure consistent enforcement of safety standards across diverse worksites.**

****Objective you are tasked with developing a computer vision model that accurately classifies workplace imagery into two categories:****

* *   With Helmet – indicating the presence of proper headgear
   
* *   ****Without Helmet – indicating the absence of required protective equipment****
      

****Your work will directly support automated safety monitoring by enabling scalable, real-time detection of helmet compliance across hazardous work environments****
