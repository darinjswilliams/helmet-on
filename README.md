**Workplace Safety Enhancement through Automated Helmet Detection**

**Ensuring safety in high-risk environments‚Äîsuch as construction sites and industrial facilities‚Äîis paramount to minimizing workplace accidents and injuries. Among the most critical safety protocols is the mandatory use of protective helmets, which safeguard personnel from head trauma caused by falling objects or operational machinery. However, lapses in helmet compliance significantly elevate the risk of severe injury or fatality. Traditional manual monitoring, particularly in large-scale operations, is often inefficient and error-prone.**

**To address these limitations, SafeGuard Corp is initiating the development of an automated image analysis system designed to detect and verify helmet usage in real time. This solution aims to strengthen safety enforcement, streamline compliance monitoring, and reduce the incidence of preventable head injuries. By replacing manual oversight with intelligent automation, the system will enhance operational efficiency, improve scalability, and ensure consistent enforcement of safety standards across diverse worksites.**

****Objective you are tasked with developing a computer vision model that accurately classifies workplace imagery into two categories:****

* *   With Helmet ‚Äì indicating the presence of proper headgear
   
* *   ****Without Helmet ‚Äì indicating the absence of required protective equipment****
      

****Your work will directly support automated safety monitoring by enabling scalable, real-time detection of helmet compliance across hazardous work environments****

**Alerting Module Overview**

### üéØ Purpose

-   Instantly notify supervisors or safety personnel of helmet non-compliance

-   Trigger automated responses to reduce delays in intervention

### ‚öôÔ∏è Key Functions

-   **Event Triggering**: When the computer vision model detects "Without Helmet," an event is generated.

-   **Notification System**:

    -   Real-time alerts via SMS, email, or in-app push notification

    -   Optional integration with walkie-talkie systems, PA systems, or smart wearables

-   **Location Tagging**: Pinpoints where the violation occurred using site cameras and geolocation metadata

-   **Severity Prioritization**:

    -   Flags multiple violations as high-priority

    -   Configurable thresholds (e.g. X violations in Y minutes triggers a site-wide alert)

-   **Logging & Escalation**:

    -   Automatically logs all alerts into the safety audit trail

    -   Escalates unresolved alerts to higher management after set time intervals

### üîÅ Feedback Loop

-   Alerts feed back into the model evaluation system to check for false positives/negatives

-   Helps improve model precision over time
